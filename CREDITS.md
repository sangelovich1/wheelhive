Claude Code (Pro Plan) has been invaluable for accelerating development, code review, and implementing complex features. The AI-assisted development approach has enabled rapid iteration and high code quality for this community-driven project.

**Note for individual contributors:** While Claude Pro is affordable and extremely helpful, usage limits can be a constraint for substantial projects. Consider pacing development sessions or exploring team plans for larger initiatives.
